# reports

This repository contains no code and instead of a (small) collection of reports I've written. This is not meant for anything but my own posterity and records. Some reports are more thorough than others and they may follow different formats (IEEE or not, formal or casual, etc). Some information about specific reports:

`SCRiPTeX-Documentation.pdf` follows the `SCRiPTeX` repository and is comprised of roughly 90%-95% of my own writing with the rest a joint effort between other team members.

`FGR Fractal Generation.pdf` follows the `fractal-generator` repository.

`genetic-decipher-document` follows the `genetic-decipher` repository.

`pso-rastrigin-document` follows the `pso-rastrigin` repository.
